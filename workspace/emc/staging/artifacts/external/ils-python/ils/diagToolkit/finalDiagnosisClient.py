# The purpose of this notification handler is to open the setpoint spreadsheet on the appropriate client when there is a 
# change in a FD / Recommendation.  The idea is that the gateway will send a message to all clients.  The payload of the 
# message includes the console name.  If the client is responsible for the console and the setpoint spreadsheet is not 
# already displayed, then display it.  There are a number of stratagies that could be used to determine if a client is 
# responsible for / interested in a certain console.  The first one I will try is to check to see if the console window
# is open.  (This depends on a reliable policy for keeping the console displayed)
